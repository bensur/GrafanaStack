# GrafanaStack
## Intro
This project's intent is to learn about Grafana products stack.
I've created most of the DockerFiles based on Grafana examples but needed to modify some of the things to make it work with docker compose and each other.
## Usage
### Start
Use `docker-compose` to start or stop the stack.

### Access products
#### Grafana
Grafana is mapped to port 3000, so you can access via http://localhost:3000.

#### Prometheus
